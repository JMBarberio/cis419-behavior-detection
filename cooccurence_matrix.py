C : K by N 
C(i, j) = 1 iff segment vj contains an
image frame whose image feature is classified as prototype pi


Working under the assumptions we have the following information handy:
- Need to know what histograms correspond to what video segment
- labels: index of the cluster each sampe belongs to
    size (N_samples, )
- centers= the actual K different protoypes


Inputs
- V_arr: N video segments 

Output: C
